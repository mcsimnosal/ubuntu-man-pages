              reporting interfaces. For example, if the following rules are added:

                ufw allow in on eth0 from 192.168.0.0/16
                ufw allow out on eth1 to 10.0.0.0/8
                ufw route allow in on eth0 out on eth1 to 10.0.0.0/8 from 192.168.0.0/16

                10.0.0.0/8 on eth1         ALLOW FWD   192.168.0.0/16 on eth0

              For the input and output rules, the interface is reported relative to the  firewall
              system as an endpoint, whereas with route rules, the interface is reported relative
              to the direction packets flow through the firewall.






              deletes the corresponding RULE

              insert the corresponding RULE as rule number NUM

       Users can specify rules using either a simple syntax or a full syntax. The  simple  syntax
       only  specifies  the port and optionally the protocol to be allowed or denied on the host.
       For example:

         ufw allow 53

       This rule will allow tcp and udp port 53 to  any  address  on  this  host.  To  specify  a
       protocol, append '/protocol' to the port. For example:

         ufw allow 25/tcp

       for the port and protocol if specifying a service by name.  Eg:

         ufw allow smtp

       supplied, the rule applies to incoming traffic. Eg:

         ufw allow in http
         ufw reject out smtp

       Users can also use a fuller syntax, specifying the source and  destination  addresses  and
       ports. This syntax is loosely based on OpenBSD's PF syntax. For example:

         ufw deny proto tcp to any port 80

       This will deny all traffic to tcp port 80 on this host. Another example:

         ufw deny proto tcp from 10.0.0.0/8 to 192.168.0.1 port 25

       This  will  deny  all  traffic  from  the  RFC1918 Class A network to tcp port 25 with the
       address 192.168.0.1.

         ufw deny proto tcp from 2001:db8::/32 to any port 25

       This will deny all traffic from the IPv6 2001:db8::/32 to tcp port 25 on this  host.  IPv6
       must be enabled in /etc/default/ufw for IPv6 firewalling to work.

         ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80,443,8080:8090

       The  above  will  allow  all  traffic  to tcp ports 80, 443 and 8080-8090 inclusive.  When
       specifying multiple ports, the ports list must be numeric, cannot contain spaces and  must
       be  modified  as a whole. Eg, in the above example you cannot later try to delete just the
       '443' port. You cannot specify more than 15 ports (ranges count as 2 ports,  so  the  port
       count in the above example is 4).

       Rules  for traffic not destined for the host itself but instead for traffic that should be
       (routing rules differ significantly from PF syntax and instead take into account netfilter
       FORWARD chain conventions). For example:

1         ufw route allow in on eth1 out on eth2
0
0       This will allow all traffic routed to eth2 and coming in on eth1 to traverse the firewall.

2         ufw route allow in on eth0 out on eth1 to 12.34.45.67 port 80 proto tcp
6
9       This rule allows any packets coming in on eth0 to traverse the firewall out on eth1 to tcp
1       port 80 on 12.34.45.67.
2
          In  addition  to routing rules and policy, you must also setup IP forwarding.  This may be
        done by setting the following in /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf:
0
          net/ipv4/ip_forward=1
2         net/ipv6/conf/default/forwarding=1
6         net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding=1
9
1       then restarting the firewall:
2
          ufw disable
          ufw enable


0       deny  connections  if  an  IP address attempts to initiate 6 or more connections within 30
        is:

          ufw limit ssh/tcp

        Sometimes it is desirable to let the sender know when traffic is being denied, rather than
0
          ufw reject auth

        supported).  For example, to allow all new incoming http connections on eth0, use:
2
1         ufw allow in on eth0 to any port 80 proto tcp
6
k       original rule was:

          ufw deny 80/tcp

        Use this to delete it:

          ufw delete deny 80/tcp
0
        if you want to delete rule number '3', use:
-
-         ufw delete 3
:
-       If you have IPv6 enabled and are deleting a generic rule that applies  to  both  IPv4  and
-       IPv6 (eg 'ufw allow 22/tcp'), deleting by rule number will delete only the specified rule.
:
-       To insert a rule, specify the new rule as normal, but prefix the rule with the rule number
-       to  insert. For example, if you have four rules, and you want to insert a new rule as rule
        number three, use:
-
-         ufw insert 3 deny to any port 22 from 10.0.0.135 proto tcp
:
-       To see a list of numbered rules, use:
-
:         ufw status numbered
-
-       all packets matching the rule.  For example, to allow and log  all  new  ssh  connections,
        use:
-
-         ufw allow log 22/tcp

:
-       Deny all access to port 53:
-
:         ufw deny 53
-
-        Allow all access to tcp port 80:

2         ufw allow 80/tcp
1
9       Allow all access from RFC1918 networks to this host:
k

         ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/8
         ufw allow from 172.16.0.0/12
         ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16

       Deny access to udp port 514 from host 1.2.3.4:

         ufw deny proto udp from 1.2.3.4 to any port 514

       Allow access to udp 1.2.3.4 port 5469 from 1.2.3.5 port 5469:

         ufw allow proto udp from 1.2.3.5 port 5469 to 1.2.3.4 port 5469

       administrators can do:

         ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 22

       flush the chains when adding or removing rules (but will when modifying a rule or changing


         ufw app list

       Users  can  specify an application name when adding a rule (quoting any profile names with
       spaces). For example, when using the simple syntax, users can use:

         ufw allow &lt;name&gt;

       Or for the extended syntax:

         ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any app &lt;name&gt;

       You should not specify the protocol with either syntax, and with the extended syntax,  use

       Details on the firewall profile for a given application can be seen with:

         ufw app info &lt;name&gt;

       where '&lt;name&gt;' is one of the applications seen with the app list command.  User's may also

       After creating or editing an application profile, user's can run:

         ufw app update &lt;name&gt;

       This command will automatically update the firewall with updated profile  information.  If
       specify  'all'  for  name, then all the profiles will be updated.  To update a profile and
       add a new rule to the firewall automatically, user's can run:

         ufw app update --add-new &lt;name&gt;


         ufw app default &lt;policy&gt;


       is not specified. Users may specify a loglevel with:

         ufw logging LEVEL

       LEVEL may be 'off', 'low', 'medium', 'high' and 'full'. Log levels are defined as:


              well as packets matching logged rules

              INVALID packets, and all new connections.  All logging is done with rate limiting.



       Loglevels  above  medium  generate  a  lot of logging output, and may quickly fill up your
       disk. Loglevel medium may generate a lot of logging output on a busy system.

       Specifying 'on' simply enables logging at log level 'low'  if  logging  is  currently  not
       enabled.

       tcp and the open state for udp, along with the address of the interface and the executable
       listening  on  the  port. An '*' is used in place of the address of the interface when the
       executable is bound to all interfaces on that port. Following this information is  a  list
       of rules which may affect connections on this port. The rules are listed in the order they
       are evaluated by the kernel, and the first match wins. Please note that the default policy
       is not listed and tcp6 and udp6 are shown only if IPV6 is enabled.

       lists IPv6-only rules after other rules.

       policy of deny, and a default outgoing policy of allow, with  stateful  tracking  for  NEW
       connections  for  incoming and forwarded connections.  In addition to the above, a default
       ruleset is put in place that does the following:

       - DROP packets with RH0 headers

       - DROP INVALID packets

       - ACCEPT certain icmp packets (INPUT and FORWARD): destination-unreachable, source-quench,
       time-exceeded,  parameter-problem,  and  echo-request  for  IPv4. destination-unreachable,
       packet-too-big, time-exceeded, parameter-problem, and echo-request for IPv6.

       - ACCEPT icmpv6 packets for stateless autoconfiguration (INPUT)

       - ACCEPT ping replies from IPv6 link-local (ffe8::/10) addresses (INPUT)

       - ACCEPT DHCP client traffic (INPUT)

       - DROP non-local traffic (INPUT)

       - ACCEPT mDNS (zeroconf/bonjour/avahi 224.0.0.251 for IPv4  and  ff02::fb  for  IPv6)  for
       service discovery (INPUT)

       -  ACCEPT  UPnP  (239.255.255.250  for  IPv4  and  ff02::f for IPv6) for service discovery
       (INPUT)

       Rule ordering is important and the first match wins. Therefore when adding rules, add  the
       more specific rules first with more general rules later.

       The status command shows basic information about the state of the  firewall,  as  well  as
       displays the filter, nat, mangle and raw tables using:

         iptables -n -L -v -x -t &lt;table&gt;
         ip6tables -n -L -v -x -t &lt;table&gt;


       ufw framework. See README for details.

       IPV6 is allowed by default. To change this behavior to only accept  IPv6  traffic  on  the
       enabled, you may specify rules in the same way  as  for  IPv4  rules,  and  they  will  be
       versions. For example, when IPv6 is enabled, the following rule will allow access to  port
       22 for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic:

         ufw allow 22

       IPv6  over  IPv4  tunnels and 6to4 are supported by using the 'ipv6' protocol ('41'). This
       protocol can only be used with the full syntax. For example:

         ufw allow to 10.0.0.1 proto ipv6
         ufw allow to 10.0.0.1 from 10.4.0.0/16 proto ipv6

       IPSec is supported by using the 'esp' ('50') and 'ah' ('51')  protocols.  These  protocols
       can only be used with the full syntax. For example:

         ufw allow to 10.0.0.1 proto esp
         ufw allow to 10.0.0.1 from 10.4.0.0/16 proto esp
         ufw allow to 10.0.0.1 proto ah
         ufw allow to 10.0.0.1 from 10.4.0.0/16 proto ah
